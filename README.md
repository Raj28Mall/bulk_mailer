# bulk_mailer

1. add option to download contact lists as csv
2. Change alerts
3. api.ts function paramter type checking
4. Template doesnt render with appropriate whitespaces (works with PRE tag but then ruins the font)



VERCEL PROMPT:
1. Add delete option for templates
2. Add delete option for template gallery and also add a "More coming soon" or something to it
3. does every contact have to belong to a LIST? if doesnt, maybe add a general (for ppl with no belonging to any lists)
4. Add a page for pricing (Make it say enthusiastically, totally free for now!)
5. Import contact support. Make it much clearer to user that they can import CSVs on both contact page and reciepient page. Also let user add manually (add the general list which dont belong anywhere specifically).
6. U can remove the filter and All contacts on the contacts page
